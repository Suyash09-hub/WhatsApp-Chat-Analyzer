Whatsapp claims that nearly 55 billion messages are sent each day. The average user spends 195 minutes per week on Whatsapp, and is a member of plenty of groups.

With this treasure house of data right under our very noses, it is but imperative that we embark on a mission to gain insights on the messages our phones are forced to bear witness to. This article aims to serve as a step-by-step guide to build your own whatsapp conversation analyzer, and is divided into the following 3 main topics:
Data Collection
Data Preparation
Data Exploration

Prerequisites
Before you can get started, ensure that the following packages are installed in your Python environment (I recommend using Jupyter since you can see intermediate outputs easily while following the steps in this tutorial):
Pandas
Seaborn
Matplotlib
Jupyter (Optional but useful since you can see intermediate outputs easily while following the steps in this tutorial) OR if you are lazy like me and don’t feel like installing any of these packages, just head over to Google Colaboratory (https://colab.research.google.com) which is a free Jupyter notebook environment that comes with everything pre-installed, and get started in a jiffy!

Data Collection
First off, we require a whatsapp conversation to analyze. Open a whatsapp conversation you wish to analyze (preferably a group chat since they tend to be larger) and use the “Export Chat” functionality to send the entire conversation in text format to your email ID.
Important Note: When prompted by whatsapp, ensure that you do not export any media otherwise it might take ages to export.
